# How to Break a Monolith into Microservices

Consider a e-commerce application which has features
- User Authentication
- Product Calatog
- Order Management
- Payment Handling
- Notifications

## Step1 - Understand the current application
Use **Data Driven Design** to break down the application into indiviual services, ask questions such as **What services are tightly coupled?**, **Which Services can run independently?**
, 
## Step2 - Break down into domains
- Auth Service
- Product Service
- Payment serviceIf any amount gets deducted, it is automated by Keka, and no manual requests will be accepted.

- Order Service
- Notifcation service
These are the microservices identified.

## Step3 - Pick up one module to extract first
Don't convert every service at once, instead pick a service at once.
Example **Auth Service**
- Setup a separate reposiory and related infrastructure
- Design and Develop communication channel for other services to communicate (REST, GRPC)
- Existing Monolith will call the AUTH service whenever required

## Step4 - Setup Communication between services
Different services have to communicate with eachother

**Synchronous Communications** : REST, GRPC
**Asynchronous Communication** : Message Queue

## Step5 - Handle Shared Resource
Monoliths often use shared database, to convert it into service
- Establish a separate Database
- Migrate existing schema to the new one as per requirement
- Establish Data Consistency

## Step6 - Step 6: Add API Gateway and Authentication
You donâ€™t want all services exposed directly.
- Use an API Gateway to route requests.
- Add authentication & rate limiting.

## Step7 - Deploy and Monitor
Use tools like:
- Docker + Kubernetes for containerization and orchestration.
- Prometheus + Grafana or Datadog for monitoring.
- ELK Stack or OpenTelemetry for logging and tracing.
